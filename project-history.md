# Project History

The Bitcoin Cash Protocol has evolved since its inception by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.  These evolutions have taken form from live network protocol changes, hard forks, and soft forks.  The greater Bitcoin community has attempted to document the protocol many times since the creation of the network.  Other documentation sources include:

- [bitcoin.it](//bitcoin.it)
- [bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference](//bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference)
- [Mastering Bitcoin](//github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) <small>(Book by Andreas M. Antonopoulos)</small>
- [BUwiki](//github.com/bitcoin-unlimited/BUwiki)
- and more...

In april of 2019, Jonathan Silverblood proposed [BUIP121](//bitco.in/forum/threads/buip121-passed-create-formal-bch-specifications.23762/) to [Bitcoin Unlimited](//bitcoinunlimited.info), which was later approved. The proposal remained inactive for some months due to lack of available talent. The idea of another attempt at documenting the Bitcoin Cash protocol was discussed at the [Bitcoin Cash City](//bitcoincashcity.com) 2019 Conference in Townsville, QLD Australia.  Josh Green, of [Software Verde](//softwareverde.com), was approached at the conference by members of the BCH development community, including Jonathan Silverblood, emergent_reasons, Josh Ellithorpe, and Mark Lundeberg to lead the effort of a consolidated descriptive specification for the protocol.  Concurrently, Andrew Stone of Bitcoin Unlimited had started [BUwiki](//bitcoinunlimited.net) with similar objectives.  Software Verde approached Bitcoin Unlimited, expressing interest in applying for the project and was accepted by Andrew Clifford and Andrew Stone.

With the funding provided by Bitcoin Unlimited, the Bitcoin Cash Protocol project began as a collaboration within the community, directed by Josh Green in December of 2019.
