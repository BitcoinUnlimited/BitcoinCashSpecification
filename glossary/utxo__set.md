<!-- TITLE: UTXO Set -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Unspent Transaction Output Set -->

The UTXO set contains information that describes the current spending constraints on every coin in the blockchain at a particular moment (generally "now").  This information is used to determine the validity of new transactions, and to report information such as wallet balances.

This data is extracted from the blockchain, which contains the full history (all transfers, spent or unspent) of all coins since their creation.
